## Solution

If we start at minute $0$ on the center rock, then notice that each duck is always on side rocks at odd-numbered minutes and on non-side rocks at even-numbered minutes.

There are six state-types to keep track of. We'll want to calculate the expected remaining minutes $E_i$ given that we're currently in a given state type $S_i$.

1. Both on center rock.
2. One on center, one on corner.
3. On opposite corners.
4. On adjacent corners.
5. On opposite sides.
6. On adjacent sides.

The omitted state-types of being both on the same corner or side rock are irrelevant because it's already game-over if the ducks are in those states. $S_1$ is far from irrelevant, though, because it is the expectation we are looking for in this problem.

We can express $E_i$, for each $i$, in terms of the values $E_j$ for each $j$ such that $S_j$ is a possible successor state to $S_i$. For example, from $S_1$, we can count on at least one more minute. But there might be more than that, in particular if we next are in $S_5$ or $S_6$. Where $T_{i,j}$ is the transition probability from state $S_i$ to state $S_j$, we have:

$$E_1 = 1 + T_{1,8}E_8 + T_{1,9}E_9$$

The transition probabilities can be calculated from the probabilities given in the problem. For example, $T_{1,5}$ is the number of different ways for that transition to happen ($4$, corresponding to the $4$ choices of side rock for a given duck) times the probability that things will go any given such way ($1/16$, which is the chance that the two ducks will make those particular $1/4$-probability choices), or $1/4$.

Doing this for all six state-types, we find that state-types $1$, $2$, and $5$ have identical expectations, so we can reduce the problem to a system of four equations:

$$A = \frac{1}{4}C + \frac{1}{2}D + 1$$

$$B = \frac{1}{2}C + \frac{1}{2}D + 1$$

$$C = \frac{2}{3}A + \frac{2}{9}B + 1$$

$$D = \frac{2}{3}A + \frac{1}{9}B + 1$$

This system can be solved straightforwardly by hand. Plugging the expressions for $A$ and $B$ into those for $C$ and $D$ yields two equations in two variables, which can be solved in the usual way. We thus find that $A$, which is our $E_1$ and hence our answer, is (exactly) $363/74$, or about $4.91$ minutes.

### Extra Credit

For a larger number $N$ of ducks, I did not see a path to an exact expectation, so we will use a simplification. We still think of the individual ducks as moving randomly among the rocks, alternating between sides and non-sides, but ignoring history otherwise. Each side rock is chosen $1/4$ of the time at odd minutes, Since the center has twice the number of adjacent side rocks as each corner, it is chosen $1/3$ of the time at even minutes, compared to $1/6$ for corner rocks.

Then, on an odd minute, the chance that all the ducks are at one rock is $1/4^{N-1}$, and on an even minute, the chance is $1/3^N + 4/6^N$. The average of these two values is our estimate of the probability that they will be on a single rock at a given minute, and the estimated expectation for the first such minute is its reciprocal, or:

$$\frac{2}{\frac{1}{4^{N-1}} + \frac{1}{3^N} + \frac{4}{6^N}}$$

For small $N$, the simplification is significant. For $N = 2$, the correct expectation value of $4.90$ is estimated at $4.24$. But it gets better proportionately, though always underestimating as far as I can tell (now "actual" values are simulations with $100,000$ repetitions): 

N | Estimate | 100K-rep Simulation
-- | -- | -- 
3 | 16.9 | 18.4
4 | 64.4 | 66.9
5 | 237 | 234
6 | 822 | 822
7 | 2795 | 2797
8 | 9266 | 9271

Since each duck has a $1/3$ chance of reaching the center rock on every even-numbered second, the estimate for the first time all the ducks meet at the center rock is $2\cdot3^N$. For large $N$, meeting on other rocks becomes vanishingly improbable compared to $2 \cdot 3^N$, and so that's the limiting expected meeting time.
