## Solution

### A recurrent approach

Given $N$ pairs of socks, let $E_i$ be the expected number of (additional) socks you'll have to pull out to get a match, given that you have already pulled out $i$ non-matching socks. 

Then, $E_N$ is $1$, because when you have pulled out $N$ non-matching socks --- one from each pair --- you are certain to get a match on the next try.

Suppose you have pulled out $i$ socks, for $0 \leq i < N$. Then your probability of getting a match on the next try is $i/(2n-i)$. If you fail to get a match, you will then expect $E_{i+1}$ more tries. Therefore:

$$E_i = \frac{i}{2N-i} + \frac{2N-2i}{2N-i} \cdot (1 + E_{i+1})$$

This lets us calculate $E_i$ for any $i$, down to $E_0$, which is the overall expected number of pulled-out socks. In the case of $N=10$, it's about $5.68$ socks. 

Because this approach doesn't require computing factorials, it's manageable to find the expectation for pretty large $N$. Doing so, we notice a pattern: the curve of $E$ versus $N$ looks like a scaled version of $\sqrt{N}$. Dividing the computed values of $E$ by $\sqrt{N}$, we find that, indeed, the ratio seems to approach a constant, which . . . is the square root of $\pi$!

Why pi? Nothing about our recurrence relation seems to promise any insight into this, so we'll try a different approach.

### A combinatorial approach, and extra credit

With $N$ pairs of socks in the drawer, we will calculate the expected value $E(X)$ of the random variable $X$, the number of pulls to yield the first pair. We will rely on the useful fact that for a non-negative, integer-valued random variable:

$$E(X) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty P(X > i)$$

So let's find $P(X>i)$. There are ${2N \choose i}i!$ ways for the first $i$ pulls to go (choices of the socks multiplied by the number of their orderings), out of which some are ways in which no pair occurs. How many? There are ${N \choose i}$ choices of pairs to have already pulled a sock from, there are $2^i$ choices of particular socks from those pairs, and there are $i!$ orderings of those socks. So:

$$P(X>i) = \frac{ {N \choose i} 2^ii!}{ {2N \choose i} i!} = {2N \choose N}^{-1}{2N-i \choose N} 2^i $$

Because the greatest $i$ for which $P(X>i)$ is non-zero is $N$:

$$E(X) = {2N \choose N}^{-1}\sum_{i=0}^N {2N-i \choose N} 2^i$$

It's a rather well-known fact that the [central binomial coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_binomial_coefficient) $2N \choose N$ asymptotically approaches $4^N/\sqrt{\pi N}$. There is a nice [proof of that fact](https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/2n_choose_n/) relying on just elementary math supplemented by the [Wallis Product formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallis_product) for $\pi$:

$$\frac{2}{1}\cdot\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{4}{3}\cdot\frac{4}{5}\cdot\frac{6}{5}\cdot\frac{6}{7}\cdots = \frac{\pi}{2}$$

This equation itself can be proven in [a really cool, demystifying way](https://www-tandfonline-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/doi/abs/10.1080/00029890.2007.11920484) "using only the mathematics taught in elementary school, that is, basic algebra, the Pythagorean theorem, and the formula $\pi r^2$ for the area of a circle of radius r." Don Knuth walks us through Johan WÃ¤stlund's proof in a fun YouTube video called ["Why Pi?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI6tt9QfRdo) that I definitely recommend viewing).

It remains to evaluate the sum:

$$\sum_{i=0}^N {2N-i \choose N} 2^i$$

Think of this sum as an absurdly complex, but absolutely correct, way of answering the question, how many different heads/tails sequences are there for $2N$ flips of a coin?

At some point in any such sequence, between flips $N$ and $2N$ (inclusive), the greatest of the tallies of heads and tails is $N$ for the last time in the sequence. Suppose that happens at flip $2N-i$, when $i \neq 0$. There are ${2N-i} \choose N$ ways that the first $2N-i$ flips might have gone. The next flip will be whichever of heads and tails has the tally of $N$, after which there are $i-1$ flips that can turn out as you please. Thus there are ${2N-i \choose N}2^{i-1}$ ways for that to happen with heads in the lead and similarly for tails, for a total of ${2N-1 \choose N}2^i$ ways. In the case of $i = 0$, there are also ${2N -i \choose N}2^i$ ways, corresponding to the ${2N \choose N}$ choices of flips to be heads. Thus, our sum counts all ways to flip a coin $2N$ times, and of course there are $2^{2N}$, or $4^N$ such ways, giving us a tidier way to express its value.

It follows that $E(X) \sim \sqrt{\pi N}$, just as we noticed computationally. Cool, no?
