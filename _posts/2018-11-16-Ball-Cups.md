>During the throwing phase, the player takes balls randomly, one at a time, from the infinite supply and tosses them at the cups. The throwing phase is over when every cup contains at least one ping-pong ball.
Next comes the pruning phase. During this phase the player goes through all the balls in each cup and removes any ball whose number does not match the containing cup.
Every ball drawn has a uniformly random number, every ball lands in a uniformly random cup, and every throw lands in some cup. The game is over when, after a round is completed, there are no empty cups.

## Solution

This is best broken down into two problems:
- How many tosses are expected before each cup has been "retired" -- filled for the first time with a ball of the same number?
- How many tosses are expected per round?

### Expected total tosses 

When $M$ cups have already been retired (for each $M$ from $0$ to $N-1$), the chance that a new ball will land in a matching cup is the chance, $(N-M)/N$, that we draw a ball matching an unretired cup, times the chance, $1/N$, that the ball lands in its matching cup.  So the chance that we retire a cup throwing a ball with $M$ cups already retired is $(N-M)/N^2$, and the total expected number of tosses is: 

$$\sum_{M=0}^{N-1} \frac{N^2}{N-M} = N^2 \sum_{M=1}^N \frac{1}{M} = N^2H_N$$

where $H_N$ is the $N$th [harmonic number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_number).

### Expected tosses per round

A cup is "visited" in a round if a ball lands in it.

If $M$ cups have been visited, the probability that a new cup is visited on a given toss is $(N-M)/N$, and so the expected number of tosses in a round is:

$$ \sum_{M=0}^{N-1} \frac{N}{N-M} = N \sum_{M=1}^N \frac{1}{M} = NH_N$$

### The answer

So the expected number of rounds to finish the game is simply $N$.

This problem amounts to two instances of the [coupon collector problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon_collector%27s_problem), wherein there are $N$ coupons with a $P$ chance of obtaining any given one on a given turn, and the problem is to calculate the expected number of turns to collect them all.  The answer is $(1/P)H_N$.  In the case of "collecting" all ball/cup matches, $P$ is $1/N^2$, because obtaining a given match requires getting the given ball ($1/N$ chance) and it landing in the matching cup ($1/N$ chance of that too).  In the case of collecting all cups in a round, $P$ is just the chance of a ball landing in a given cup, or $1/N$.
