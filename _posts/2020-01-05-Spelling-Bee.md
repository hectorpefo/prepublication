>The New York Times recently launched some new word puzzles, one of which is Spelling Bee. In this game, seven letters are arranged in a honeycomb lattice, with one letter in the center. The goal is to identify as many words that meet the following criteria: The word must be at least four letters long. The word must include the central letter. The word cannot include any letter beyond the seven given letters.
>Note that letters can be repeated. For example, the words GAME and AMALGAM are both acceptable words. Four-letter words are worth 1 point each, while five-letter words are worth 5 points, six-letter words are worth 6 points, seven-letter words are worth 7 points, etc. Words that use all of the seven letters in the honeycomb are known as “pangrams” and earn 7 bonus points (in addition to the points for the length of the word). 
>
>Which seven-letter honeycomb results in the highest possible game score? To be a valid choice of seven letters, no letter can be repeated, it must not contain the letter S (that would be too easy) and there must be at least one pangram.

## Solution

This is a computational problem, so I'll let the code mostly speak for itself. A brute-force approach is feasible because there are "only" about 56,000 possible bees. The requirement that there be at least one pangram is what really constrains that number down from the millions that otherwise would be possible. There are about 8,000 pangram-sets, and we only need to determine the words that are generable from each of them. Our approach, then, is to find all pangram-sets, and then to assign to each of them a list of all the words that can be formed from its letters. Finally, for each pangram-set we score the seven bees that can be made from it, and report the winner. The output is supplied below. The winning bee, which produces 693 words for a score of 4,036, contains letters AEGNIRT, with R in the center.

```python
# Find the highest possible score for the NYT Spelling Bee game, using a supplied
# word list as the dictionary. Runs in 23.6sec in pypy (a fast way to run
# python code) on an older PC.

wordsFile = "538Words.txt"

# Return sorted list of distinct letters in the word
def lettersIn(word):
  letters = []
  for letter in word:
    if not letter in letters:
      letters.append(letter)
  letters.sort()
  return letters

# Get list of bee-possible words

  for word in wordsFile:
    word = word[:-1] # pare trainling newline character
    letters = lettersIn(word)
    if len(word) >= 4 and len(letters) <=7 and not 's' in word:
      wordsList.append(word)

# Scan word list for words with 7 distinct letters; these can be pangrams, and every
# bee uses a set of letters that has a pangram.
pangramTuples = []
for word in wordsList:
  letters = tuple(lettersIn(word))
  if len(letters) == 7 and not letters in pangramTuples:

  hiveWordLists[pangramTuple] = []
  pangramSets.append(set(pangramTuple))

# This takes the bulk of run time

      s += len(word)
      if len(lettersIn(word)) == 7:

  return s

# Score all bees, i.e., all pangram 7-tuples and all choices of center letter
highestSoFar = [0,[]] 
for pangramTuple in pangramTuples:
  for centerLetter in pangramTuple:
    s = score(pangramTuple,centerLetter) 
    if s > highestSoFar[0]:
      highestSoFar = [s,[pangramTuple,centerLetter]]

# Report results
print 'Maximum score is', highestSoFar[0], 'for the bee [(letters), center letter]:'
