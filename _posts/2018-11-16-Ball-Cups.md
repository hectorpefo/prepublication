>Youâ€™re going to play a game. Like many probability games, this one involves an infinite supply of ping-pong balls. No, this game is not quite beer pong.

>The balls are numbered 1 through N. There is also a group of N cups, labeled 1 through N, each of which can hold an unlimited number of ping-pong balls. The game is played in rounds. A round is composed of two phases: throwing and pruning.
>
>During the throwing phase, the player takes balls randomly, one at a time, from the infinite supply and tosses them at the cups. The throwing phase is over when every cup contains at least one ping-pong ball.
Next comes the pruning phase. During this phase the player goes through all the balls in each cup and removes any ball whose number does not match the containing cup.
Every ball drawn has a uniformly random number, every ball lands in a uniformly random cup, and every throw lands in some cup. The game is over when, after a round is completed, there are no empty cups.

## Solution

The "rounds" and "phases" are a red herring; the problem is to figure out how many tosses are expected before each cup has been "retired" -- filled for the first time with a ball of the same number.

When $M$ cups have already been retired (for each $M$ from $0$ to $N-1$), the chance that a ball will land in its matching cup is the chance, $(N-M)/N$, that we draw a ball matching an unretired cup, times the chance, $1/(N-M)$, that the ball lands in its matching cup.  So the chance that we retire a cup throwing a ball with $M$ cups already retired is always $1/N$, and so we expect $N$ throws to retire the next cup.

So the total expected number of tosses is $N$ (for the $N$ cups that need to be retired) times $N$ (for the number of tosses always expected to retire the next cup), or $N^2$, which means $N$ rounds.
