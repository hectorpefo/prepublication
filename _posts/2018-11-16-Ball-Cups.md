>During the throwing phase, the player takes balls randomly, one at a time, from the infinite supply and tosses them at the cups. The throwing phase is over when every cup contains at least one ping-pong ball.
Next comes the pruning phase. During this phase the player goes through all the balls in each cup and removes any ball whose number does not match the containing cup.
Every ball drawn has a uniformly random number, every ball lands in a uniformly random cup, and every throw lands in some cup. The game is over when, after a round is completed, there are no empty cups.

## Solution

This is best broken down into two problems:
- How many tosses are expected before each cup has been "retired" -- filled for the first time with a ball of the same number?
- How many tosses are expected per round?

### Expected total tosses 

When $M$ cups have already been retired (for each $M$ from $0$ to $N-1$), the chance that a ball will land in its matching cup is the chance, $(N-M)/N$, that we draw a ball matching an unretired cup, times the chance, $1/(N-M)$, that the ball lands in its matching cup.  So the chance that we retire a cup throwing a ball with $M$ cups already retired is always $1/N$, and so we expect $N$ throws to retire the next cup.

So the total expected number of tosses is $N$ (for the $N$ cups that need to be retired) times $N$ (for the number of tosses always expected to retire the next cup), or $N^2$.

### Expected tosses per round

A cup is "visited" in a round if a ball lands in it.

If $M$ cups have been visited, the probability that a new cup is visited on a given toss is $(N-M)/N$, and so the expected number of tosses in a round is (where $H_N$ is the $N$th [harmonic number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon_collector%27s_problem):

$$N\left( \sum_{M=0}^{N-1} \frac{1}{N-M} = NH_N$$

### The answer

So the expected number of rounds to finish the game is:

$$  \frac{N^2}{NH_N} $$
