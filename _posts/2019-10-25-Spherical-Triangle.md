## Solution

For simplicity, we'll work with a unit sphere (of surface area $4\pi$) and find the angle $\alpha$ needed for a triangle of area $\pi/4$.

In the figure, note that the sides of the triangle lie on three great circles each pair of which (like all pairs of great circles) intersect twice, at polar opposite points on the sphere.

A *lune* is a section of a sphere's surface bounded by two such great circles. Since these circles intersect with an angle $\alpha$, then the area of the lunes is $\alpha/2\pi$ times the surface area of the sphere, or $2\alpha$. Each pair (of three pairs total) of the circles determines two lunes of angle $\alpha$, for six in total. 

Notice that the three circles determine also a second, congruent triangle on the far side of the sphere.

If we add the areas of all six lunes, yielding $12\alpha$, we cover the entire sphere, but in doing so we count the area $A_T$ of our triangle three times, and similarly for that of the second triangle, for a total over-count of $4A_T$. So:

$$12\alpha = 4\pi + 4A_T$$

$$\alpha = \frac{\pi + A_T}{3}$$

If $A_T$ is $\pi/4$, then $\alpha$ is $5\pi/12$, or $75$ degrees.
